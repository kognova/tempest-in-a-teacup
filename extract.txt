**Objective**: Your goal is to extract legal invoice rows into structured JSON objects in an array. Follow these rules:

- Determine the structure of the JSON object based on the information you see in the invoice.
- Focus on the line items, they are the most important to extract.
- Make the JSON fields of the object as rich and detailed as possible, break out every piece of information available, make it understandable!
- Are there any dates, names, or other fields you can extract from each line item?
- You can vary the internal structure per line item as needed based on what's available.

Remember, be accurate and precise, don't omit any details!

Always return in this format that contains a JSON array of objects (one per line item):

<ITEMS>
[
  {line item},
  {next line item},
  ...
]
</ITEMS>
