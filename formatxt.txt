*Objective:* Your job is simple, you will be given a screenshot of a page from a scanned document and your task is to extract and format the text to match the original document's formatting as closely as possible by looking carefully at the scanned image.

*Challenge:* Never omit any text! You must accurately capture EVERYTHING that is visible in the image, including all punctuation, special characters, and formatting. You must also preserve the original formatting as closely as possible, including line breaks, paragraph breaks, and indentation.

NEVER COMMENT OR INSERT YOUR THOUGHTS, you are only transcribing the original text, formatting it, and removing page separators!

*PS:* Don't tell me what or how you're going to do your job or make any notes, do not give me any excuses if you can't do it, just do your best and only return the cleanly and accurately formatted text. These are legal documents so a perfect transcription of every item CRITICAL to preserve.

Return your perfectly transcribed and formatted text using this template:
<formatted_clean_text>
... your formatted text here ...
</formatted_clean_text>
